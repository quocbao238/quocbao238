### About Me
I'm B·∫£o, a dedicated software developer with expertise in both mobile and web development. I specialize in Flutter for cross-platform mobile applications, using Dart to create responsive, native-like experiences on iOS and Android. My knowledge extends across architecture patterns like MVC, MVP, and MVVM, ensuring scalable and maintainable applications. I'm also skilled in state management solutions such as Riverpod, BLoC, Provider, and GetX, which I use to create dynamic and efficient Flutter applications. I am experienced in leading projects from development through deployment on platforms like the App Store and Play Store.

In web development, I am skilled in Next.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS, allowing me to build efficient, modern, and user-friendly web applications.

Passionate about continuous learning, I stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends, writing clean, efficient code to deliver high-quality applications that meet client needs and drive innovative solutions.
